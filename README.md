# Custom Cursor Navigation with Hover Effects

This project showcases a custom navigation bar with interactive hover effects and a unique cursor animation. It replaces the default browser cursor with a custom circular cursor that interacts with the user's actions.

## Features

- **Custom Cursor**: A white circular cursor that follows the user's mouse movement across the screen.
- **Hover Effects**: The cursor enlarges when hovering over navigation links, and the link text shifts slightly to follow the pointer for a dynamic experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The navigation layout automatically adjusts based on screen size, ensuring an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Smooth Transitions**: All animations, including cursor movements and hover effects, are designed to be smooth and fluid for a seamless user experience.
